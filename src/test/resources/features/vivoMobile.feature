Feature: Search Functionality on Flipkart

  As a Flipkart user
  I want to search for Vivo mobile phones
  So that I can view relevant products and their specifications

  Background:
    Given the user opens the browser
    And navigates to the Flipkart homepage
    And closes any login popup if displayed

  @Smoke @Regression @mobile
  Scenario Outline: Search for various Vivo mobile models and verify search results
    When the user enters "<search_keyword>" into the search bar
    And clicks on the search button
    Then the page title should contain "<expected_title>"
    And the search results header should display "<search_keyword>"
   ## And all listed items on the first page should contain "<expected_brand>" in their titles

    Examples:
      | search_keyword      | expected_title | expected_brand |
      | vivo T5 Lite        | Vivo           | vivo           |
      | vivo T5 Lite 44W 5G | vivo           | vivo           |
